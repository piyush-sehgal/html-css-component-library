    <h2>@links</h2>
    
    <p>Anything which connect to other thing is a link</p>
    <p>We define it using anchor tag and use a attribute href to redirect</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
    <a href="/">Primary link</a>
    <a href="/">Secondary link</a>

    <p>Note: If we write something and it takes entire row, then it's called block elements</p>
    <p>Note: If we write something and it does not takes entire row, it takes it's own space, then it's called inline elements</p>
    <p>H3, p, div are block elements</p>
